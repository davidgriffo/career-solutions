This project is a re-engineering of an existing native Windows application.
Taking a stand alone .EXE system and presenting it as a Web2.x application.
The technologies include

* HTML5
* CSS3/Sass
* AngularJS
* Slim
* NotORM
* Bootstrap
* Git (obviously)
* Composer
* Bower
* PHP 5.x
* jQuery

It will be implemented as a RESPONSIVE/FLUID site that will be at home on fondleslabs.
The development stack will operate on a Linux/UNIX or Windows machine.
We will use an agile methodology.  The KISS principle is being implemented here!
